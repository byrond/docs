# Programming Shots with the Rail Camera

The rail camera is normally used in "Live Motion" mode with the controller. This can sometimes lead to jittery
or unexpected movements as the controls are very sensitive. We can program the camera to move back and forth
between two fixed points indefinitely to give us consistent and smooth movement. The director can then choose
to take the camera when the desired shot is available.

When programming the camera, we can control:
* Start and end points, including
    * position on the rail
    * tilt and pan
    * zoom level
* Duration of the shot (longer is slower)
* How long the camera waits at each point (dwell)
* How quickly the camera movement gets up to speed (ramp)

## Steps

* If the camera is in Live Mode, press left on the D-Pad to get to the menu.
* Select "Programmed Shots" by pressing down on the D-Pad, then press "X".
* Use the D-Pad to select Start Point, then press "X".
* Use the controller as you would in Live Mode to set the camera slide position, as well as the tilt/pan/zoom.
* Press "X" to lock in the Start Point.
* Select End Point and press "X".
* Position the camera at the desired End Point in the same way you set the Start Point. (A good setup is to have the start point on one end, zoomed out and centered. Then, the end point can be on the opposite end, zoomed out and centered. It's a good idea to keep the subject centered at both points, so it doesn't seem to "drift" during its movement. Also, be sure to keep a little distance from the end of the rails when setting each point.)
* Press down on the D-Pad to go to the next screen of settings.
* Choose "Duration" and press "X".
* The time should automatically change to the amount of time it took to slide from the start point to the end point.
* Adjust the duration as desired (longer makes the camera move slower; about 1 minute is a good speed from end to end). Press "X" to lock in the duration.
* Set the Dwell start and end. This is the amount of time the camera will pause once it reaches each point.
* Go to the next screen of settings, and set the "Ramp" time. A setting of about 3 seconds will allow the camera to smoothly start and stop at each point and eliminate jerking and bouncing.
* Set the "Shot Style" to "Ping-Pong". This tells the camera to go back and forth between both points continuously.
* Go to the next page of settings and press "X" to tell the camera to move to the start point.
* Finally, press "X" to run the program.
* When you're ready to stop the program, press "X". You will then have the option to repeat the program, reverse it, or reset.
* Reset will take you back to the programming options. You can change and run a new program, or press left on the D-Pad to get back to the main menu and go back to Live Mode.
