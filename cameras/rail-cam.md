# Programming Shots with the Rail Camera

The rail camera is normally used in "Live Motion" mode with the controller. This can sometimes lead to jittery
or unexpected movements as the controls are very sensitive. We can program the camera to move back and forth
between two fixed points indefinitely to give us consistent and smooth movement. The director can then choose
to take the camera when the desired shot is available.

When programming the camera, we can control:
* Start and end points, including
    * position on the rail
    * tilt and pan
    * zoom level
* Duration of the shot (longer is slower)
* How long the camera waits at each point (dwell)
* How quickly the camera movement gets up to speed (ramp)
