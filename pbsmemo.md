PBS Team,

As you consider your "Fork in the Road" decision, I want to
update you on our developing strategy for PBS. Let me first express my appreciation for all the suppor have received in getting up to speed and assessing PBS's organizational structure and portfollo. You will not be surprised to learn that this analysis has revealed a gross excess of space in the portfolio as well substantial levels of deferred maintenance. The combination of these two factors is resulting in excess spending combined with
suboptimal working conditions for the federal workforce at many locations. 

It is clear that the footprint (leased and owned) of non-DoD federal building space should be reduced by at least 50%. This reduction will come from more efficient space utilization, as well as an overall downsizing of the federal workforce. The associated reduction in O&M costs (operations and maintenance costs for both external contractors and internal support) and deferred liabilities will enable us to deliver higher-quality work environments over a smaller, more appropriately-sized footprint. In addition, by transitioning from an agency-centric model of space utilization to a "whole government" approach that assesses requirements and availability across agencies, we expect to further consolidate and reduce space, as well as downsize the associated support staff
and other PBS resources.

With regard to PBS's organizational structure, we have concluded that the "Regional" model is both outdated and inefficient. In the immediate future, we will effectuate a restructuring along functional reporting lines rather than the current matrix of regions and functions. This more streamlined organization will allow the majority of our remaining personnel the flexibility to provide service across the entire geographic footprint in response to surges in demand and provide improved resource utilization and
efficiency.

This is not a novel idea, but the new Administration's commitment to efficiency and taxpayer savings, combined with the recent Water Resources Development Act of 2024 (WRDA) legislation, provide GSA with the tools and support needed to execute this
plan.

While this plan is still not fully formed, I wanted you to be aware of it as you consider your "Fork in the Road" decision. GSA is going to be a substantially smaller organization in the future. I am excited to work with a highly motivated team to affect transformational change, If you want to join me on this mission to transform how PBS functions and to set an example for other federal agencies, be prepared for the hard work and difficult decisions that will be required to right size PBS. For those of you who choose to resign or retire, I thank you for your service and wish you the best in
your future endeavors.

Michael
